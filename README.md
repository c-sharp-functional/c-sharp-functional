# Farity
An intuitive functional library for C# programmers

**[Work In Progress]**

## Why Farity?
TODO: specifically for functional programming, immutability and whatnot.

## What's different?
TODO:
Pure functions
Type safety not lost to dynamic functions
Convenient to curry or partially apply

## Philosophy
TODO:
should feel intuitive, practical, functional. should not fight C#.

## Installation
There are not yet any packages available for installation yet.

## Build
TODO:
There is heavy reliance on DOTNET core, make that explicit,
and explain how to build for different systems.

## Documentation

## The Name
We wanted something that starts with an F, and something to do with functions.
A short name that isn't already taken. Occam's razor landed us 'F' + 'arity'.
No, it's that simple, really. Hopefully we make good use of it.

## Using the test suite
TODO:
Uses xunit, should be elaborated
Can use VS test runner
or dotnet test
