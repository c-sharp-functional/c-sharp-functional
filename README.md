# Farity
An intuitive functional library for C# programmers

**[Work In Progress]**

## Why Farity?

TODO:

* specifically for functional programming,
* immutability
* and whatnot.

## What's different?

TODO:

* Pure functions
* More extensibility and deferred execution using LINQ (of course)
* Function composition and higher order functions are encouraged
* Type safety not lost to dynamic functions
* Convenient to curry or partially apply

## Philosophy

TODO:

* should feel intuitive, practical, functional.
* should not fight C#.

## Installation

TODO:

* There aren't any packages available for installation yet.

## Build

TODO:

* There is heavy reliance on DOTNET core, make that explicit,
* explain how to build for different systems.

## Documentation

TODO

## The Name

We wanted something that starts with an F, and something to do with functions.
A short name that isn't already taken. Occam's razor landed us 'F' + 'arity'.
No, it's that simple, really. Hopefully we make good use of it.

## Using the test suite

TODO:

* Uses xunit, should be elaborated
* Can use VS test runner
* or dotnet test

## Acknowledgements

TODO:

* inspired by ramda
